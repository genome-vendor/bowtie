Version Release History
=======================

Version 2.0.0-beta5 - December 14, 2011
   * Added --un, --al, --un-conc, and --al-conc options that write unpaired
     and/or paired-end reads to files depending on whether they align at least
     once or fail to align.
   * Added --reorder option.  When enabled, the order of the SAM records output
     by Bowtie 2 will match the order of the input reads even when -p is set
     greater than 1.  This is disabled by default; enabling it makes Bowtie 2
     somewhat slower and use somewhat more memory when -p is set greater than
     1.
   * Changed the default --score-min in --local mode to G,20,8.  This ought to
     improve sensitivity and accuracy in many cases.
   * Improved error reporting.
   * Fixed some minor documentation issues.
   * Note: I am aware of an issue whereby longer reads (>10,000 bp) drive the
     memory footprint way up and often cause an out-of-memory exception.  This
     will be fixed in a future version.

Version 2.0.0-beta4 - December 5, 2011
   * Accuracy improvements.
   * Speed improvements in some situations.
   * Fixed a handful of crashing bugs.
   * Fixed some documentation bugs.
   * Fixed bug whereby --version worked incorrectly.
   * Fixed formatting bug with MD:Z optional field that would sometimes fail to
     follow a mismatch with a number.
   * Added -D option for controlling the maximum number of seed extensions that
     can fail in a row before we move on.  This option or something like it
	 will eventually replace the argument to -M.
   * Added -R option to control maximum number of times re-seeding is attempted
     for a read with repetitive seeds.
   * Changed default to --no-dovetail.  Specifying --dovetail turns it back on.
   * Added second argument for --mp option so that user can set maximum and
     minimum mismatch penalties at once.  Also tweaked the formula for
     calculating the quality-aware mismatch penalty.

Version 2.0.0-beta3 - November 1, 2011
   * Accuracy improvements.
   * Speed improvements in some situations.
   * Fixed a handful of crashing bugs.
   * Fixed a bug whereby number of repetitively aligned reads could be
     misreported in the summary output.

Version 2.0.0-beta2 - October 16, 2011
   * Added manual, both included in the download package and on the website.
     The website will always have the manual for the latest version.
   * Added Linux 32-bit and 64-bit binary packages.  Mac OS X packages to come.
     Still working on a Windows package.
   * Fixed a bug that led to crashes when seed-alignment result memory was
     exhausted.
   * Changed the --end-to-end mode --score-min default to be less permissive.
     The previous threshold seemed to be having an adverse effect on accuracy,
     though the fix implemented in this version comes at the expense of some
     sensitivity.
   * Changed the --end-to-end mode -M default to be lower by 2 notches.  This
     offsets any detrimental effect that the previous change would have had on
     speed, without a large adverse impact on accuracy.  As always, setting -M
     higher will yield still greater accuracy at the expense of speed.

Version 2.0.0-beta1 - September 22, 2011
   * First public release.
   * Caveats: as of now, the manual is incomplete, there's no tutorial, and no
     example genome or example reads.  All these will be fixed in upcoming
     releases.
   * Only a source package is currently available.  Platform-specific binaries
     will be included in future releases.
